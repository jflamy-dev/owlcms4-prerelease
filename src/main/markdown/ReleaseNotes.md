**For older releases, please scroll down.**

From February 1, 2020, releases will be in separate release channels, to keep stable releases separate from potentially less stable preliminary releases used for testing and translation.  Once that change is done, clicking on the link of your choice in the table will get you to the correct location for downloading or installing.
